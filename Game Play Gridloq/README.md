# Gridloq Game

## Game Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Game Engine**
   - Handles game loop and core mechanics
   - Manages game state and transitions
   - Controls timing and frame updates

2. **Game State Management**
   - Main menu state
   - Gameplay state
   - Pause state
   - Game over state

3. **Entity Component System (ECS)**
   - Player entity
   - Enemy entities
   - Game objects
   - Components for behavior and attributes

4. **Input System**
   - Handles player input
   - Maps controls to game actions
   - Supports multiple input methods

5. **Rendering System**
   - Handles graphics and visual effects
   - Manages sprites and animations
   - Controls camera and viewport

6. **Physics System**
   - Handles collisions
   - Manages movement and interactions
   - Controls game world boundaries

7. **Audio System**
   - Manages sound effects
   - Handles background music
   - Controls audio states
