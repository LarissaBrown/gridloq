            <p>A PowerUp Booster is automatically given once a day.  It allows a player to have a higher chance of winning a specific power up on every spin for one game. Example: If you buy a bomb power up booster, the chances of winning that bomb on every spin goes from 1:12 to 1:6 chance. You are limited to 1 PowerUp Booster per game.</p>
